# For loops

# Write a loop that prints all the dates in January. So your program will print
#
# January 1
#
# January 2
#
# January 3
#
# ... more dates here ...
#
# January 30
#
# January 31

#for day in range(1, 32): # numbers are where to start at and 1 more than where to end at
#   print('January ' + str(day)) # no need to modify loop counter

    # both are same!!

for day in range(31): # repeat 31 times
    print('January ' + str(day + 1))  # add 1 to loop counter variable
